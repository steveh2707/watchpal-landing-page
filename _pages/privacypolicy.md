# Privacy Policy
At WatchPal, we prioritize your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your data when you use the WatchPal app.
<br>

## 1.0 Data Collection
WatchPal does not collect or store any of your personal data on our servers. All your app-related data, such as watchlists, progress tracking, and custom lists, is stored locally on your device and synced securely via Apple iCloud to your other devices.
<br>

## 2.0 Data Syncing via iCloud
To enable seamless cross-device usage, WatchPal uses Apple's iCloud service to sync your app data. This process is managed entirely by Apple, and WatchPal does not have access to the data stored in your iCloud account. For more information on iCloud's privacy practices, please refer to Apple's Privacy Policy.

Content Information APIs

The Movie Database (TMDB): https://www.themoviedb.org/privacy-policy
